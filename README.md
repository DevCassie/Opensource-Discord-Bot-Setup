## What does this project do?
This project is a simple setup for Discord Bot creation. This project is a very simple starting point for creating your own Discord Bot. It has a command handler built-in, so you don't have to worry about that anymore.

This is a project for the people who are getting stuck or are tired of writing a bot setup over and over again.

## Getting started
1. Install node.js (latest version);
2. Install a code editor (atom, Visual Studio Code, etc.)
3. Clone the repository.
4. Open your project in the code editor and launch a terminal in the root folder of your project.
5. In your terminal type `npm init`. This is going to ask you a few questions. Answer those questions.
6. Run `npm i` to install all the packages that come with this project.
7. Create a bot account [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
8. Back in your code editor create a `.env` file in your root directory. 
9. Take a look at the .env.example file and paste that in.
10. Now try to run the project with `npm run start`.
